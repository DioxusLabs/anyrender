AnyRender is a 2D drawing abstaction that allows applications/frameworks to support many rendering backends through a unified API.

Discussion of AnyRender development happens in the Linebender Zulip at <https://xi.zulipchat.com/>.

## Crates

### `anyrender`

The core [anyrender](https://docs.rs/anyrender) crate is a lightweight type/trait-only crate that defines three abstractions:

- **The [PaintScene](https://docs.rs/anyrender/latest/anyrender/trait.PaintScene.html) trait accepts drawing commands.**
  Applications and libraries draw by pushing commands into a `PaintScene`. Backends generally execute those commands to
  produce an output (although they may do other things like store them for later use).
- **The [WindowRenderer](https://docs.rs/anyrender/latest/anyrender/trait.WindowRenderer.html) trait abstracts over types that can render to a window**
- **The [ImageRenderer](https://docs.rs/anyrender/latest/anyrender/trait.ImageRenderer.html) trait abstracts over types that can render to a `Vec<u8>` image buffer**

### Backends

Currently existing backends are:

- [anyrender_vello](https://docs.rs/anyrender_vello) which draws using [vello](https://docs.rs/vello)
- [anyrender_vello_cpu](https://docs.rs/anyrender_vello_cpu) which draws using [vello_cpu](https://docs.rs/vello_cpu)
- [anyrender_vello_hybrid](https://docs.rs/anyrender_vello_hybrid) which draws using [vello_hybrid](https://docs.rs/vello_hybrid)
- [anyrender_skia](https://crates.io/crates/anyrender_skia)<sup><b>BETA</b></sup> which draws using Skia (via the [skia-safe](https://github.com/rust-skia/rust-skia) crate)

Contributions for other backends (tiny-skia, femtovg, etc) would be very welcome.

### Content renderers

These crates sit on top of the the AnyRender abstraction, and allow you render content through it:

- [anyrender_svg](https://docs.rs/anyrender_svg) allows you to render SVGs with AnyRender. [usvg](https://docs.rs/usvg) is used to parse the SVGs.
- [blitz-paint](https://docs.rs/blitz-paint) can be used to HTML/CSS (and markdown) that has been parsed, styled, and layouted by [blitz-dom](https://docs.rs/blitz-dom) using AnyRender.
- [polymorpher](https://github.com/Aiving/polymorpher) implements Material Design 3 shape morphing, and can be used with AnyRender by enabling the `kurbo` feature.

### Utility crates

- [wgpu_context](https://docs.rs/wgpu_context) is a utility for managing `Device`s and other WGPU types
- [pixels_window_renderer](https://docs.rs/pixels_window_renderer) implements an AnyRender `WindowRenderer` for any AnyRenderer `ImageRenderer` using the [pixels](https://docs.rs/pixels) crate.
- [softbuffer_window_renderer](https://docs.rs/softbuffer_window_renderer) implements an AnyRender `WindowRenderer` for any AnyRenderer `ImageRenderer` using the [softbuffer](https://docs.rs/softbuffer) crate.


## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of AnyRender has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.86** and later.

Future versions of AnyRender might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
